# Explicit Validation Documentation

This documentation covers the explicit validation features of the library, based on the examples provided in the 'examples/ExplictValidation' directory. Explicit validation is used to ensure data integrity and correctness by explicitly checking for specific conditions or constraints on data.

## Overview

Explicit validation involves using specific functions to validate data against predefined rules. These functions can check for array types, object keys, string lengths, numeric ranges, and boolean values. The examples in the 'examples/ExplictValidation' directory demonstrate various scenarios where explicit validation is applied.

## Examples

The following sections will detail the examples provided in the 'examples/ExplictValidation' directory, explaining how each example uses explicit validation to ensure data correctness.
